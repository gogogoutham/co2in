What is CO2IN?
----------------

CO2IN (pronounced "see-oh-too" coin) is a fork of Litecoin built for (self)-educational purposes. 

THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVE CRYTPOCURRENCY AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS SUCH. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Parameters are as follows:

 - 20% premine
 - 2.5 minute block targets
 - difficulty re-adjustment every block through [DigiShield](http://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/comments/1zjeso/eli5_what_is_digishield/)
 - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 - ~105 million total coins
 - 50 coins per block

Currently the client must be built from source.
